# Career Development
## Reflection

**Situation**
As an ICT student who's dreaming of starting his dream career, I had to discover myself first. We had five learning objectives to read through:
1. Know yourself
2. Understand a job vs a career
3. Identify a chosen career options
4. Define a career goal
5. Create a career plan

**Task**
 I had to develop a career development plan, where I learn the difference between a job and a career, discover, clarify and set my career goals while taking my interests into consideration.
 
 **Action**
 I completed chapter quizzes, to test my understanding and knowledge about the chapters and set goals that relevant to my studies.
 
 **Results**
 I learned the difference between a career and a job, and the importance of a career development plan.
